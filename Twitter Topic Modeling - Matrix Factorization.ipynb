    "My name is Ignacio Antequera Sanchez and in this project I will use the techniques for recommender systems in an unexpected way to help us model topics found on Twitter. Throughout this project, I will practice extracting topics from tweets using matrix factorization. This method assumes every tweet is a combination of several topics weighted by their prevailance in the text. This approach in fact finds a low-dimensional representation of the tweets (through the topic weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be working with tweets about the pandemic 2020 when the pandemic entered our lives. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-late-april?select=2020-04-30+Coronavirus+Tweets.CSV) and the preprocessing we have done followed the steps [here](https://www.kaggle.com/satanizer/covid-19-tweets-analysis). For computational speed we will first analyze a dataset from one day: April 30, 2020. I encourage you to explore this dataset further and see how topics change over time. I might include some additional analysis from other different days in the future and study how topics change over time\n",
